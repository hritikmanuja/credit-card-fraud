# credit-card-fraud-detection-mini-project

Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders.



Our goal is to develop a predictive model for whether an account will default next month, given demographics and historical data.We will develope the practical application of the model.
